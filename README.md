# CleanCDICE

The folder Burke reports the code used to implement a surrogate model representing growth type economic impacts from climate change to the economy.

The folder CDICE include the code used to run optimizations, simulations, and the generation of figures.

The folder FAIR reports all the code used to calibrate the surrogate neural model to compute carbon absorption efficiency of land and ocean sinks.

The folder Uncertainty reports the uncertainty analysis for the stochastic disturbances.

To run the scripts in order to produce the figures, data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5996773 should be included in the CleanADCDICE folder.
