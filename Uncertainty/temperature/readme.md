Here the stochastic model for temperature is built.
The file "temp_functions.py" contains the defition of the functions used in the analysis.
The file "temperature_disturbance.py" analyzes the residuals and derives the temperature disturbance to be used in the DICE model
To replicate:
- run temperature_disturbance.py
